            <div class="container">
                <p>After what has seemed like an eternity in the build up to the release of this film; Five Night's at Freddy's movie is finally here! Scott Cawthon's
                    innovate horror franchise has finally hit the big screen, and if I'm being honest it is quite a polarizing debut for such a beloved game series. The
                    critics seem to heavily dislike the film as their ratings of it are overwhelmingly negative, and it's score on Rotten Tomatoes is roughly 23%. But, the 
                    audience score is 80%, a heavy difference. There's one key reasoning for this, and it's also the reason why it's so good. 
                </p>

                <p>The reasoning this film isn't the most well received by casual viewers and critics with no prior knowledge on the franchise is that it is heavily based on
                    the lore that has been previously set in all of the game's installments. The franchise has 9 previous video games, all with a unique story that contributes to
                    the overall backstory established in the first installment. It plays off a lot of the backstory and knowledge you would acquire from playing the games, and so 
                    if you go in with no prior knowledge it can be quite confusing and dis-interesting. 
                </p>

                <p>I like many others who enjoyed the video games, especially the first trilogy really enjoyed the film. The video games were so unique and different at the time within
                    the horror genre, it was like nothing we had seen before. It really caused the game to blow up, and find quick online success YouTubers who did play-through's and deep
                    dives into the games lore.  Those play-through's and deep dives are what really made the gaming community fall in love with the game, why it was able to have NINE, NINE installments
                    all having great success. From MatPat to CoryXKenshin, both of whom made guest appearances, these creators all invested us into the backstory and lore of the game. That lore
                    is quite complex, which makes Five Night's At Freddy's such a good franchise, and for those like myself who enjoyed the games such a great film. The replication of the animatronics to
                    the big screen was great, they weren't as scary, but the aura was still there. There was quite a few moments that made my smile since they were direct callbacks to the games,
                    and the ending for me was quite great. I also the think the lead performance were quite great as they provided a lot of emotion and intricacy to an other-wise subhuman plot. 
                </p>

                <p>I think this films mantra can be simply stated; it is for the fans. It's not catered towards general audiences, or people who are heavily critical of films.
                    It is catered towards the franchises fans. The people who have watched the let's plays and the game theories, who have been there since 2016 playing supporting
                    scott and his innovate horror franchise. I don't think this film is for anybody, but most people in my age group and younger are fans of the franchise, fans
                    of Freddy Fazbear and all the lore that comes with him, so this film is for them. It's for its audience, and that audience is wide, but it most definitely doesn't
                    involve the majority of critics, and the older audiences who simply just don't get it.
