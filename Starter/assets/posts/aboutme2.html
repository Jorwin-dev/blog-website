                <p>I am a music enthusiast. There are few things that captivate me and make me feel as much emotion as music. I listen to it more than anyone should, I even make it
                    every once in a while. I believe it is the greatest form of expression humans have, as so much can be said, so much impact can be made. Albums are something I feel are 
                    underappreciated. I always hear people say they love an artist or a genre of music, but can only pick select songs that they love, not an album. The essence and message
                    that come with an album and it's sequencing, cover art & rollout are important for the music; It's like the cover for a book. The following albums are my top 10 favorites,
                    and though this was a hard list to make I was able to select just 10. 10 different albums. 10 different artists. All meaningful and impactful for my music experience, and 
                    for some music as a whole. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 10: The Invitation (2015) - </strong>This is one of the most unsettling, eerie films I have seen. The Invitation is a unique horror film that has so much to offer. 
                    Logan Marshall-Green as Will delivers one of my favorite lead performances in any horror film. His performance of the character has so much depth and emotion it really draws you 
                    into the screenplay (which is superb) and provides the x factor to the film. This is another realistic horror film, in the sense of it not involving absurd fantasy villains and such. 
                    And, as I've said in previous entries these types of films are the best horror films to me. These scenarios can, and quite literally do happen, and so it just adds this unsettling 
                    feeling of realism. I'd also like to mention the cinematography and score, as these two aspects are subtle in their uniqueness, but that subtlety really makes the film what it is. 
                    I can't rave enough about it; it is truly one of the best films I've seen in a while.
 

                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 9: Green Room (2015) - </strong>One of my absolute favorite horror films of all time; Green Room sets the bar for the modern slasher. Over recent times the slasher 
                    sub-genre has become oversaturated, full of mediocre films all following the same formula. Green Room is a breath of fresh air, an original idea masterfully crafted and executed. 
                    It's thrilling, suffocating, and absolutely gruesome. It's a fully immersive experience throughout, full of moments that leave the viewer thinking “what just happened”. I love the 
                    cast and performance of the leads, as well as the editing/cinematography. The way in which the film is shot and the emphasis on the character's really makes you feel more when events 
                    occur in the film. The premise is truly terrifying to me, as the scenario is quite possible & realistic. I find a concept/plot like this much more frightening than say a zombie or ghost 
                    film. I can't recommend this film enough. It's absolutely amazing; A24 doesn't miss.

                </p>


                <p><strong>Number 8: Train To Busan (2016) - </strong>This is not only one of the best horror films I've ever seen, but one of the best films I've ever seen period. It's thrilling, emotional, and unique. 
                    Asian films have honestly never let me down, as the pacing & screenplay are always impeccable and this film is no different. The characters are all great and you really feel connected to them and their 
                    progression through the film. The antagonist of the film is written perfectly. I TRULY despise them. There were a couple scenes that slightly missed the mark, but that's just nitpicking as overall the film 
                    conveyed its messages well. There are so many subplots and lessons throughout which lead you down so many emotional paths as the film progresses. I was never 'scared' as this isn't a scary film, but it incorporates 
                    horror well in telling its overarching story. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it. I went in expecting a lot and it met all of my expectations, so believe me you'll be captivated.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 7: The VVitch (2015) - </strong>This is by far one of the best horror films ever made. It has everything that makes the genre my favorite, everything that makes any film great; it's near flawless. The 
                    VVitch is intense, unnerving, and desolate. It evokes the feeling of dismalness; inevitability. The cinematography is so well crafted, with the use & emphasis on lighting and still shots really driving home the feelings 
                    the films wants you to feel. That in tandem with the score & use of sound allow for a truly captivating experience. This film is all about getting you to feel like something is off, like there's just this sense of dread, 
                    and desperation. The cast excel at making this mood possible. The entire family excel at their roles and have masterful performances. But, the two standouts are Ineson as William & Taylor-Joy as Thomasin. They really just 
                    put their all into their performances as co-leads. Williams character-arc is amazing, and Inesons use of expression & inflection bring it up another level. This was Anya Taylor-Joy's breakout performance, and rightfully so. 
                    From the first 15 you can tell that Thomasin's the root of the story, the character that makes the story what it is. And, as I've said in previous films, the third act is what makes horror films; Taylor-Joy's performance MADE 
                    this horror film. Her performance in the last 30, especially in the final scene, is the peak of the film; it's legitimately perfect. If you can't tell by now, this is a must watch film in my opinion. It's so unique and well executed, 
                    displaying the expansivity of the genre; affirming why A24 is PEAK cinema.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 6: Scream (1996) - </strong>An innovator in the slasher genre, Wes Craven hit the ball on the nail with this film. Scream is hilarious, gruesome, & unique. Out of that original 90's slasher trio consisting of Michael Myers & Halloween, 
                    Jason & Friday The 13th and of course Ghostface & Scream, I think the latter is by far the best. Ghostface isn't the most ominous villain, as he really just is a mortal person in a mask, but his execution within the films makes him the best villain in my opinion. 
                    I will openly admit though that Myers and Jason are just cooler because they are basically immortal but the execution of Ghostface was just better. Scream was legitimately a revitalization of the slasher genre. This film is so important for the history of Horror. 
                    It's plot was absolutely great. It has a lot of true crime aspects which I love since I'm a fan of true crime, but that cast man. That cast is one of the greatest of all time. From Neve Campbell to Steve Ulrich to Drew Barrymore and even Matthew Lillard there are 
                    too many stellar actors to name. My favorite character's were probably Stu Macher (Lillard) and Dewey (Arquette). They provide comedic relief throughout the film and that comedy aspect is what separates the film and makes it so unique. Scream could honestly be higher 
                    as I really love it and it's a very palatable, good introduction to the horror genre, but the films above it just edge Scream due to the impact they have for me personally. But, that doesn't take away from the importance of his film, as I can confidently say it is by far 
                    the most important film in my top 10, and arguably one of the most important of all time. 
 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 5: Saw (2004) - </strong>My introduction into the Horror genre, Saw is captivating, gruesome, & jaw-dropping. Saw as a franchise tends to have a bad wrap as the latter films after the first few were plotless and excessively gruesome, but the first trilogy of 
                    films & the most recent iteration Saw X display why the franchise is one of the greatest in Horror. The first Saw movie is a true crime horror hybrid and it is executed to absolute perfection. Bell as Kramer is probably my joint-favorite horror villain of all time alongside Ghostface. 
                    Kramer is one of those villains that doesn't understand they are a villain, that thinks they are doing good. Those characters always have the most depth in my opinion, and Kramer's story arc in this film and the franchise as a whole displays that. The cast also has stellar leads in Elwes 
                    and Whannel as Adam & Gordon, which provide the greatest moments in the film through their dynamic, and of course how can we forget the masterful Danny Glover as Detective Tapp which is one of the most impactful characters in the film. I wish people would give the franchise more of a chance 
                    because due to the multitude of sub-par sequels a lot of people just disregard any of the films but trust me Saw has some amazing installments, and Saw 2004 is simply an amazing film. It revolutionized and pioneered low budget films, allowing lower-resourced film makers to have a shot which can't be understated.

                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 4: Hereditary (2018) - </strong>This is a modern classic. A film that is just so special, so unique and well executed. Ari Aster is one of the greatest film-makes within horror; film-makers in general honestly. From this point onward any of these films could've been my #1, as 
                    they are just 10/10 top tier films. This film has everything from the cinematography and score which add such an ominous atmosphere to the film, to the plot/screenplay which are so intricate and captivating. But, the cast and their performance are what elevate the film to that upper echelon. 
                    Wolff does an amazing job as a co-lead as his emotion and expression with the character of Peter are just absolutely great. But, Toni Collette man. What a performance. I genuinely believe she was fully snubbed of not just an oscar nomination, but of a win for best actress in a leading role. 
                    She makes the film what it is. Her emotion and passion in the role. Her progression/character arc is just sublime. I can't praise her performance enough. It's the best performance from a lead in a horror film of all time. If you haven't watched this film you have to. It will have your jaw on the floor, 
                    you'll get that feeling you get when you know you've just watched something amazing; it's just that good. 

                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 3: Rec (2007) - </strong>Rec, to me is the joint best found footage film horror ever made. It's a masterful composition of all aspects that make horror my favorite genre. It's my joint favorite horror film; it's terrifying, frantic, and incredibly intense all the way through. The film 
                    is so raw and interpersonal, as the way it's shot allows for you to get to know the characters well. Velasco (Ángela) is an amazing lead character, her emotion and intensity drive the film forward, providing a much stronger connection to what is happening. The surrounding cast is also great at making 
                    the film feel very normal; human in a sense, setting up the events in the film to be much more impactful. Rec has possibly the best 3rd act I've seen in a horror film. The final 30 minutes make the film an absolute classic. I just think this film has everything you want in a horror film, and since I'm a 
                    native Spanish speaker it makes the experience that much better. I'd definitely recommend you watch this. It's a genre defining film that sets the precedent for the found-footage subgenre.

                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 2: As Above, So Below (2014) - </strong>As Above, So Below is everything I love about horror; it's the reason horror is my favorite genre. The film is gripping, terrifying, and absolutely suffocating. I am a big fan of found footage, first-person shot horror films, as I believe it elevates 
                    the cinematography to a level that really makes you feel the terror of the film. Watch it with good headphones on a large-screen laptop and you'll see just how much more intense your experience is. Weeks (Scarlett) & Feldman (George) put in amazing performances as the leads. Scarlett's devotion to finding 
                    the stone, honoring her father, is what leads them down this absolute rabbit hole. The film gets better as it goes on, and with a run-time of ~90 mins that works in its favor. The 1st act is slightly tedious, but it really sets you up to understand the cast. The 2nd act really immerses you, as once they make it 
                    into the catacombs there is no going back. Then THAT 3rd act. WOW. The third act is what makes the film. It's captivating & scary as all hell. The creativity of the scares, the cinematography, and THAT SCORE man. The score makes you feel so uneasy and makes those scares that much more frightening. If you haven't 
                    watched this film you're missing out. I know it's not the most well reviewed film, but trust me the critics aren't right on this one. Visiting The Paris Catacombs is on my bucket list because of this film; IT'S THAT GOOD.

                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 1: The Menu (2022) - </strong>Now this; this is PEAK. I had previously watched this film with my cousin in Guatemala as she had recommended it to me, and I really enjoyed it the first time but upon rewatching it was EVEN BETTER. The Menu is everything I love about film; it's definitely one of my top 5 
                    favorite films of all time. It's intriguing from the jump, with a star studded cast and co-mains of Anya Taylor-Joy & Ralph Fiennes. Anya is by far in a way my favorite actor at the moment. I haven't watched a film of hers that I didn't like and The Menu is no different. The Menu is humorous, suspenseful & riveting. 
                    It's extremely well crafted with such a unique premise. Anya's character is the perfect lead amongst the rest of the cast, and Fiennes' role as the 'villain' is amongst the best I have seen in a horror film. I don't want to talk much about the plot, as it's so unpredictable and complex that I don't want to spoil anything. 
                    Just know that this is a must watch film for everyone. It's a perfect blend of so many aspects that make a film great with cinematography, soundscapes, visuals & a cast that ensure you enjoy the film.

                <p>Albums are a lost art. They are so special, but with recent music trends they're importance had been demeaned. Album composition and rollout is key to the albums overall presence. There is so much beauty in it,
                    as there is so much that goes into it. This has been lost with modern music, as albums have just become a group of songs that have no connection to one another. These albums stand out amongst that. Though not 
                    all modern, they all represent the beauty of what an album is and can be. The thought that goes into it; the craft. As a producer and aspiring musician myself, I hope to one day create an  album on the caliber of 
                    these. These are all examples of just how great music can be; why music is the greatest form of expression we have to offer.
