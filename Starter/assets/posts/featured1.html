            <div class="container">
                <p>A monumental show with a larger-than-life card, Crown Jewel had a lot to live up to. From a battle of generations between John Cena & Solo Sikoa,
                    to the return of the Pirate Princess Kairi Sane, and of course the main event between the hottest star in the business The Megastar L.A. Knight, and the Tribal
                    Chief, the longest reigning World Champion of the modern era, the one and only Roman Reigns. There was so much going on, with a sold out crowd in Saudi Arabia
                    let's break down the show segment by segment and see just how good the show was.  
                </p>

                <p><strong>Kickoff Show Match: Sami Zayn vs. JD McDonagh:</strong> This match was very much so 'filler'. A typical RAW Brand babyface against a member of the Judgement Day. It was
                    fun nonetheless, with JD doing what he does best, with his ridiculously over the top selling of moves. Sami is one of the favorites for the Saudi audience so 
                    the match was basically made for him to get a win in front of them. I'm not mad at it though as who doesn't love Sami Zayn. This was just a solid kickoff match 
                    to set the tone and get the crowd riled up and ready for the PPV. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>World Heavyweight Championship: Seth Rollins (c) vs. Drew McIntyre:</strong> Now this was the match I was looking the most forward too as Drew McIntyre in my opinion
                    has the best developing storyline in WWE at the moment, and this was primed to be a BANGER. The wrestling was great as expected it was probably the 3rd best
                    match of Rollin's title reign thus far, just behind Finn Balor at Summer Slam and Nakamura at Fastlane. I know a lot of die-hard fans are quite upset with Rollins
                    getting the win again, as he has beat so many fan favorites thus far in his Title Reign, but trust me this was 100% the right decision. Drew losing clean allows for 
                    him to become even more obsessed and angered, which hopefully leads to his eventual heel-turn and introduction into Judgement Day. So, though I also want to see Drew as 
                    world champion, I didn't expect it to happen at this PPV, but once he's heel it will most definitely happen; we will be waiting. 
                </p>


                <p><strong>Women's World Championship Fatal 5-Way: Rhea Ripley (c) vs. Nia Jax vs. Raquel Rodriguez vs. Shayna Baszler vs. Zoey Stark:</strong> Now I'm just gonna be honest here, we all knew
                    the outcome of this match before it even happened. But, that doesn't take away from it being a fantastic match. Rhea Ripley is one of the 5 hottest superstars in the company,
                    and so having her finally defend the belt again, especially in a match with this much against her was great. The match was full of exciting spots and moments as all of the 
                    wrestlers bring different aspects to the bout (yes, even Nia.) and so it led to some high-flying spots, some powerful spots, and even some insane 3-4 superstar spots. I will say 
                    that the Saudi crowd really let these women down though, as their reactions to the match were non existent. Very little cheers or boos or even gasps at the insane spots like where
                    Zoey Stark literally jumped over the cameraman and took out all the other competitors. This lack of excitement for the women's matches became apparent with the other women's match 
                    later in the night, which really does suck as both matches were great. Overall though an enjoyable match for anyone who enjoys wrestling. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>John Cena vs. Solo Sikoa:</strong> Man. Man, man, man. This one hurt to watch. John Cena, like for many other fans in my demographic, is my favorite wrestler of all time. He's from Massachusetts,
                    embodies great values, and always had high level matches. His promos leading up to this watch were riveting, so many great lines and a continued message of questioning whether he still
                    had it, whether he could end his 1000+ day singles win drought. We all knew he would be going back to Hollywood after a few months with WWE, so even though I knew this could be his last
                    match for a while, I didn't expect it to end the way it did. Solo did what Solo does, he absolutely destroyed and ended Cena. The match had a few good Cena moments, but nothing truly convincing
                    His best spot was hitting the 5 Moved of Doom, but besides that it was all Solo. The ending is what really did it. Solo hit him with like 13 Samoan Spikes it was just absolutely brutal, and after being
                    pinned and losing the match you had a beautiful moment where the Saudi crowed cheered John and thanked him, but it was bittersweet as Michael Cole on commentary made it seem like that was it.
                    Like that was Cena's last match with the company, and honestly I'm not ready for this to be it for him. So, hopefully he'll be back again in the future and win #17. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>United States Championship: Rey Mysterio (c) vs. Logan Paul:</strong> This was another pretty good match. Rey Mysterio and Logan Paul are two dynamite wrestlers made to get a crowd up on their feet 
                    and excited, so it was great to have it after such an emotional bout. I will say though that the 1st half of the match was very odd, as it was more wrestling than high-flying which isn't 
                    really either wrestlers specialty, but once it picked up it was great. A lot of good spots and the outcome was as expected. As much as I love Rey Mysterio his title reign was honestly going
                    nowhere so it was time to take the belt off of him. Logan Paul can have a lot of exciting matches and draw a lot of eyes to the belt, which I'd assume he'll hold until Wrestlemania 40 where 
                    he loses to L.A. Knight YEAH!
                </p>

                <p><strong>WWE Women's Championship: Iyo Sky (c) vs. Bianca Belair:</strong> This match was phenomenal. I am a big fan of Iyo Sky and though the odds of her keeping the title in this rematch against Super-Bianca Belair
                    were slim I was hopeful that she would do it, and she did. It had many great wrestling moments from Bianca as expected and great high-flying moments from the Genius of the Sky Iyo. I wasn't surprised
                    that Bailey got involved as thats just been her role as the leader of Damage CTRL, but it was an awesome surprise to see the Pirate Princess Kairi Sane back after 3+ years. Seeing her interfere at the
                    end and help Iyo return, then embrace with Iyo was great, as there was already tension within Damage CTRL, so adding Kairi into the mix, one of Iyo's best friends & rival of Bailey since Bailey was the one 
                    who got Kairi kicked out of WWE by beating her, sets up an important decision for Iyo, and an amazing plot-line for Smackdown's women's division. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Cody Rhodes vs. Damian Priest:</strong> This was probably my least favorite match, as it felt out of place in this card for me. Crown Jewel was full of high caliber, meaningful matches and Priest v Rhodes 
                    is just something we see at the end of RAW every week. Nonetheless it had some great moments which is as expected since Cody and Damien are two of the best WWE has to offer. The Saudi crowd absolutely 
                    loved Rhodes so I'd assume this match served a similar purpose as the kickoff one, just to get Cody the biggest babyface in the company on the card. There was one spot near the end of the match where Cody
                    hit his signature move the Cody Cutter off the top rope which was sick, but besides that it was a decent match with a predictable outcome, and nothing more. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Undisputed WWE Universal Championship: Roman Reigns (c) vs. LA Knight:</strong> THIS. IS. CINEMA. The hottest superstar in all of sports entertainment, The Megastar L.A. Knight YEAH! vs the one and only,
                    The Head of the Table, The Tribal Chief, the longest reigning WWE champion of the modern era Roman Reigns. This match had PEAK written all over it, and though the outcome was predictable I think it 
                    definitely delivered. The crowd were more alive for this match than any of the previous, which really added to the grandeur of it all. L.A. Knight had an amazing showing in his first ever major title match.
                    We all knew he wasn't going to win but he definitely Swam. He showed that he could wrestle with the best, engage a crowd, and provide shock moments, all the things needed for a top-tier performer. Roman did what 
                    Roman does; he won by any means necessary. Knight had him beat, but as always The Bloodline do what they must to protect their Tribal Chief, and through interference and other shenanigans, somehow, someway Roman
                    won and retained his championship. This was a win win for both parties, establishing Knight as a true main-event player in WWE, and extending Roman's historic reign. What a great main event. 
                </p>

                <p>Overall, Crown Jewel 2023 was pretty good. It wasn't perfect by any means, but it wasn't anywhere near bad either. It had amazing spots and matches. It set
                    up storylines for the future, and established a good few superstars as big names. My least favorite match of the night was Cody vs Damien for obvious 
                    reasons, and my favorite of the night was the Women's World Championship Fatal 5-Way. I love how they made all the women look Badass and even though the crowds
                    lack of enthusiasm for the match took away from it slightly, the wrestling & moments were good enough to make it my favorite of the night. I'm really excited to see 
                    what's next for the likes of Zoey Stark, LA Knight & Iyo Sky.
