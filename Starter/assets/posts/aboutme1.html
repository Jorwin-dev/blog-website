                <p>I am a music enthusiast. There are few things that captivate me and make me feel as much emotion as music. I listen to it more than anyone should, I even make it
                    every once in a while. I believe it is the greatest form of expression humans have, as so much can be said, so much impact can be made. Albums are something I feel are 
                    underappreciated. I always hear people say they love an artist or a genre of music, but can only pick select songs that they love, not an album. The essence and message
                    that come with an album and it's sequencing, cover art & rollout are important for the music; It's like the cover for a book. The following albums are my top 10 favorites,
                    and though this was a hard list to make I was able to select just 10. 10 different albums. 10 different artists. All meaningful and impactful for my music experience, and 
                    for some music as a whole. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 10: I Can't Decide.</strong> There is no 10th spot. I cannot decide on just 1 more album. It's between Rodeo by Travis Scott, channel ORANGE by Frank Ocean,
                    Saturation II by BrockHampton, DECIDE by Djo, and Loose by Jack Harlow. This will be updated once I decide which is 10th, if I ever even do. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 9: 18 Months by Calvin Harris - </strong>EDM & House music has always had a soft spot for me. I grew up in the era of club bangers being radio hits. 
                    The era where Alesso, Martin Garrix, Zedd, David Guetta & of course Calvin Harris were on the top of the charts, and 18 Months is by far my favorite EDM 
                    project by any of the aforementioned. Calvin Harris had always been my favorite DJ as he often incorporated his own vocals in his songs and I found that 
                    quite unique. I will start off with the fact that I don't think 18 Months is perfect. There's a few songs on the project I fully dislike and don't listen to, 
                    but those tracks are outweighed by the poignancy of the top tier tracks on the album, which are some of the greatest EDM tracks ever. A track like We Found Love 
                    (feat. Rihanna) is top tier perfection alongside other tracks like I Need Your Love (feat. Ellie Goulding) & Let Go (feat. Ne-Yo) these large scale collaborations 
                    that are excellently executed are what define the project for me. But, my personal favorites are School, Sweet Nothing (feat. Florence Welch),  Thinking About You 
                    (feat. Ayah Marar) and of course how could I forget Feel So Close, arguably the most well recognized track from his discography, and from the genre itself in the 
                    modern era. School is a short interlude-esk track that is straight sound no lyrics and I love how it's executed where it's placed in the tracklist. Sweet Nothing 
                    comes right before School and its beat drop is so heavy and in your face I absolutely love it. It's a nice contrast with Florence's soft voiced & grandiose performance. 
                    Thinking About You is the outro track, and it's my favorite track off the album. I love Marar's lyrics and vocal performance. It's impactful but doesn't take away from 
                    the absolute masterclass in production and engineering by Harris. The beat on this song is perfection, and his use of vocal chops and plucks really just put this track 
                    on another level for me. These tracks are why the album is one of my favorites even though it has some weak points. They are just so nostalgic and well executed that 
                    I can overlook the shortcomings and focus on the greatness of the peaks. 
                </p>


                <p><strong>Number 8: Around The Fur by Deftones - </strong>This is the most recent inclusion into my top 10, as I was introduced to Deftones this August through my other half. 
                    I honestly thank her very much for doing so, as Deftones have become my favorite band of all time, and one of if not my favorite artist(s) of all time. It was quite difficult 
                    to think of which album to include in this list, as I don't think they have a bad album in their discography; A lot of them are 9-10 level projects. Saturday Night Wrist probably 
                    has my favorite songs by them & White Pony is their magnum opus, probably their overall best project, but Around The Fur was the album I was introduced to them with, so it's just 
                    special to me. I was taken aback by the sound as numetal was something I had never experienced. I never even really liked metal to begin with but this has opened my ears to the genre 
                    and I love it now. Around The Fur is so in your face and drawn out. So intense and unique. There are quite a few riffs and drum patterns that have you absolutely banging your head. 
                    Tracks like My Own Summer & Be Quiet and Drive are regarded as the best from the project, and I do think that is for good reason as they are definitely the most expansive and palatable. 
                    But, my personal favorites are Around The Fur, Rickets & Lotion. They are just so in your face 100% intensity and I love it. The soundscape combined with Chino's voice is just such a unique 
                    experience. This album has 0 songs that aren't amazing, and with a runtime of almost 1 hour that's quite impressive. I could praise the album all day long, and praise Deftones all day long 
                    but the gist is that they are just an amazing, underrated band that anyone should give a listen to because they aren't just metal, their musical ability is diverse so there's something for anyone. 

                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 7: good kid, m.A.A.d city by Kendrick Lamar - </strong>This isn't just music; this is art. good kid, m.A.A.d city is widely regarded as one of the best Hip-Hop albums of the decade; 
                    I believe it is arguably the best ever. The album's cover touts it as a short film, and it really feels like that. Storytelling had become a lost art in Hip-Hop, a method of rapping that had been 
                    poorly executed by even the biggest names. Kendrick Lamar stepped in and made a 1 hour & 13 minute long concept album telling a cohesive from track to track, all of them playing a key role in the story. 
                    It blew me away the first time I listened to it front to back, as it's perfectly executed. Sherane is one of the greatest intros of all time. The Art of Peer Pressure is one of the greatest concept storytelling 
                    tracks of all time, it really immerses you and makes you feel like you are there witnessing all that Kendrick is explaining. But I wanted to emphasize what I consider to be not just the greatest Hip-Hop song of 
                    all time, but the greatest song of all time period; Sing About Me, I'm Dying Of Thirst. This track is 12 minutes long. It's two songs in one, the first being Sing About Me, and the second being I'm Dying Of Thirst. 
                    I'm Dying of Thirst is intense with its subject matter and sporadic production. It deals with facing your demons, really confronting that which haunts you so you can stop “dying of thirst”. I absolutely love it, as 
                    it's a stark contrast in sound to the 1st half, Sing About Me. Sing About Me is 6 and a half minutes of sheer perfection. It tells such a moving story and has a cohesive message that really hits me in the heart. The 
                    first time I listened to the track I genuinely teared up and cried, as it moved me that much. This album is just that. It's a convection of emotion. A masterclass in storytelling by the greatest lyricist of modern times. 
                    An artist that makes real art; meaningful and real art. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 6: Swimming by Mac Miller - </strong>Mac Miller's last album before is unfortunate and unexpected; Swimming is an emotional escapade. I absolutely adore the sound of this album; it was unlike anything Mac 
                    had done previously. Mac Miller is one of my favorite artists of all time, and this album is really what established him to that standard for me. Swimming is one of those albums you have to listen to all the way through 
                    and experience. It's sound is quite sad yet hopeful, a dynamic that really interests me. That sound really hits hard in hindsight with his passing, as he seemed so hopeful for the future. Tracks like Hurt Feeling, What's 
                    the Use? & Ladders are just perfect in my opinion, but the two standouts are Self Care and Dunno. They are some of my most played tracks as they just fill me with emotion and that to me is what music and art is all about. 
                    Self Care has two different sounds conjoined by a beat switch that is just otherworldly when it hits. The line “I got all the time in the world so for now I'm just chilling. But I know it's a, it's a beautiful feeling in Oblivion” 
                    is one of my favorite lines of all time, and alongside the production it's just so so good. Then, Dunno is just a special track. Mac Miller just talks about life and says some super relatable things that really hit home. The production 
                    is slow which allows emphasis for his voice. It's like he's talking for you, saying things that you'd been feeling but couldn't let out. The album as a whole is like that. It's so special and its sequel Circles is nearly as good. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 5: 2014 Forest Hills Drive by J. Cole - </strong>This album is the album that got me into Hip-Hop. I had not listened to Hip-Hop much before this album dropped but this album really really hit me and made me love the genre 
                    and deep dive into the genre that I am so involved and invested in today. It's his most popular album and is considered his magnum opus, and I do think that's for a strong reason. I don't think it's his best but I do think it's his most 
                    impactful and most meaningful for his career and discography. The intro track is just perfect. It's just so beautiful I absolutely love it. I love Apparently that's the song that I really got hooked on when I started listening to this album 
                    and my favorite song off the album is either St. Tropez or Love Yourz; Those are amazing. I don't think there's a bad track on the album. I just think the album runs through perfectly. It's a little longer but that doesn't make any difference. 
                    It doesn't overstay its welcome because it really draws you in. The production is great and it switches up a lot. He has some great storytelling songs. Wet Dreams is arguably one of the best storytelling songs of all time. He has some more introspective 
                    tracks like Love Yourz and his outro Note To Self where he just shouts out all of his producers, engineers, family and friends. It's great, it's just like Kanye West's Last Call and that's one of the best outros of all time. I just think this album is 
                    great in all aspects. It doesn't disappoint. It really really captivates you and puts you into that J. Cole music space that is bar heavy with introspective lyrics and insane flows. If you keep up with rap music you know he's only gotten better from this 
                    point and this I'm really excited to see what's next for one of the modern greats. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 4: Unorthodox Jukebox by Bruno Mars - </strong>This album man. It's just the pinnacle of Pop and the pinnacle of Bruno Mars to me. Bruno Mars is my favorite pop artist. I think he is so good. He is the inheritor to that Michael Jackson big time, 
                    performer, dancer, singer, type of an artist/performer. A lot of people aren't the biggest fan of this album in comparison to his other projects, but I really really enjoy it. The intro track Young Girls is just so powerful it really hits you and gets you into the 
                    mood for the album. You have When I Was Your Man on this, one of his saddest, most heartfelt songs. And, you have Locked Out Of Heaven which is a true pop banger, so this album really has a little bit of everything, something for all types of listeners and I really 
                    really think it's top tier pop music. I haven't been the biggest fan of pop music since the early 2010's. I don't think it offers anything new anymore but this album is just a special man, it really really is and Bruno Mars is probably my favorite vocalist not including 
                    font-men/women in bands because I don't think that that's fair as Bruno Mars is on his own. He's a performer, he's a full-on spectacle. He's a very very special artist and this album to me is his peak. It is his pinnacle, it is everything you want a pop album to be and it 
                    is just executed perfectly; Bruno Mars is that guy.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 3: Apricot Princess by Rex Orange County - </strong>Apricot Princess is a very unique and honestly near perfect album. I was never the biggest fan of Rex Orange County previous to listening to the album. I had honestly never heard of him before this album but 
                    it really led me into an immense discography, and he is now one of my favorite artists ever. From front to back this album has in my opinion zero skips; it's just so good. From Television / So Far Good to Untitled to 4 Seasons, Waiting Room and of course, arguably my favorite 
                    song of all time Never Enough, this album just has so much to offer to the listener. The tracklist is quite expansive, there's a few sadder tracks and those are very good, some more uplifting or positive tracks and some just really good sounding Jazz, R&B & Pop Fusion ones which 
                    are absolutely great and of course some alternative in there as well. It's a fusion melting pot of a bunch of genres, and I think it's very well executed by Rex. I love his voice. It's very poignant. He does some slam poetry talking at times when he sings and it's very unique. I love 
                    how he does it. The album also doesn't overstay its welcome. It's only 10 songs and under 40 minutes so it's a quick listen and definitely worth the listen. I absolutely adore the album and I absolutely adore the artist.
 
                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 2: 808's & Heartbreak by Kanye West - </strong>808s & Heartbreak is by far my favorite Kanye album, though I don't think it's his best. This album was released at a very tumultuous time in his life. It was after his mom passed away. It was a way for him to cope and express 
                    emotion bottled inside of him, and the sound really portrays that desolate, sad, just hopeless feeling, contrasted with a hopeful feeling towards the end of the album. It's beautifully executed and it really changed Hip-Hop because before this album, there were no albums like it. At the time 
                    there were no albums where one of the biggest rappers on the planet was so vulnerable and emotional. Tracks like Bad News, Street Lights and Pinocchio Story are all so so sad and it just really hits you in those areas of the heart when you listen to the album all the way through. It also introduced 
                    new sounds to mainstream Hip-Hop, with a lot of autotune and punchy drums alongside atmospheric production. I am a lover of production and instrumentation, so this album really played to what I love about music. I discovered it not even that long ago like two or three years ago cause I wasn't a Kanye West 
                    fan, but this album really made me fall in love with his music, and I think he is just a genius. This album is probably the most important in his discography in terms of impact for the rap game, because this really pioneered a new genre within hip hop where rappers were allowed to be vulnerable and expressive of 
                    their emotions, as we have seen now with rappers like Juice WRLD, Lil Uzi Vert, and Drake. These artists rap about male emotional issues and that is pioneered by Kanye West and this album, so it really did change the landscape of hip-hop and that is why it is so high for me because it just means so much to me & the genre itself. 

                </p>

                <p><strong>Number 1: Under Pressure by Logic - </strong>Logic's Under Pressure is simply a very special album to me. It's the first album to really make me fall in love with Hip-Hop. The album that I mentioned previously 2014 Forest Hills Drive is the first Hip-Hop album I fully listened to, but Under Pressure is the first hip-hop album 
                    that I really enjoyed and loved. And so this album is really the reason I love producing music and the reason I love listening to Hip-Hop. It's what led me to becoming such a big fan of the genre to the point where I am involved in it. There are so many good tracks on this from the title track Under Pressure, it's nine minutes long but 
                    it is truly amazing. It's like a book or a movie about Logic's life in nine minutes; It's really just so good. Songs like Metropolis, Buried Alive, Intro and the outro track Till The end; all S tier amazing. There's just so much to love with this album. In my opinion there's very few flaws. It's production is very boom-bap, there's a lot 
                    of sampling it's very sporadic, very in your face production with slick bars. I just think it's great. I don't think it's the best album that is on this list but it's by far in large, the most impactful and important album in my listening history and so it has to be number one for me.

                <p>Albums are a lost art. They are so special, but with recent music trends they're importance had been demeaned. Album composition and rollout is key to the albums overall presence. There is so much beauty in it,
                    as there is so much that goes into it. This has been lost with modern music, as albums have just become a group of songs that have no connection to one another. These albums stand out amongst that. Though not 
                    all modern, they all represent the beauty of what an album is and can be. The thought that goes into it; the craft. As a producer and aspiring musician myself, I hope to one day create an  album on the caliber of 
                    these. These are all examples of just how great music can be; why music is the greatest form of expression we have to offer.
